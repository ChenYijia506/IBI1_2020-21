The question is "How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain"?

The line number of the code to answer this question is line 49-60.

In the plot which is produced based on the dataset, it is easy to conclude that both the number of new cases and total cases stayed at a low level from 2019.12.31 to 2020.03.10. However, the number of new cases and total cases increased at extremely high speed on March 10,2020.
Since then, there has been an exponential growth in the number of total cases. After 2020.03.10, the number of new cases increased strikingly at first, and fluctuated around a relatively high level.

The plot is similar with what I expected because the epidemic broke out suddenly last year. Since the breakout took place, the increment in infected population increased a lot at first then fluctuated around a certain level.

In my opinion, the reason for why the data might look the way it does is that the number of infected persons was small at first, which failed to arouse people's attention. As a result of accumulation, the number of infected persons reached a relatively large number but the patients still got in touch with many other people because the society did not pay much attention to it. Therefore, the breakout of the COVID-19 epidemic took place. As there was a delay in taking appropriate measures, the number of infected population increased exponentially and the increment was a large number.
