The majority of my problems is in the code portfolio of Week 5 and Week 6. According to the formative feedback, there were some indention errors and some Chinese “,” or “)” which made the codes fail to work at first. In addition, I misunderstood some pieces of requirement in the guidance therefore I forgot to write the corresponding codes: 
1.	I wrote the codes to sort the list but I did not write the codes to print the sorted list out in Practical 6. 
2.	I did not print all the terms in the Fibonacci list out in Practical 5.
3.	I did not print the frequency table and the title of the pie chart in Practical 6.


What I did to improve my codes:
1.	I corrected the indention errors on print function and at the for loop, as well as the Chinese character following the formative feedback.
2.	I add the codes to list all the items in the Fibonacci list, 
3.	I add the codes to print the sorted list out and the title of the pie chart.
